# Personifine

[Personifine](https://personifine.com) is a full-stack web application designed as a clean, ad-free platform for showcasing creative writing. The goal is to provide a distraction-free space for readers and writers, and the code is provided here publicly for showcasing purposes.

**NOTE:** Personifine is a work-in-progress. Right now, authorship is limited to me and a select few collaborators, and some site details are subject to change.

## Future Improvements

I want Personifine to grow beyond me into a competent site that many people can contribute to and enjoy. Planned future additions include:
- UI/UX Improvements
- Public-facing workflows for creating stories and chapters
- Support for custom images and thumbnails
- And more!

### Thank you for taking the time to look at Personifine. I hope you enjoy the stories within.
